# Telegram Bot Template

That is template for telegram bots based on next stack of technologies:

* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
* [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)
* [Telegram Bot API Library](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/TelegramBotAPI) (by default everything is included like
it was described [here](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/TelegramBotAPI#ok-where-should-i-start))

## Default

Since you have used this repo as a template you can copy file `example.config.json` as `local.config.json`, put there your bot token and simply run command `./gradlew run --args="local.config.json"`. As an output you will get your bot information like:

```bash
ExtendedBot(id=ChatId(chatId=1234567890), username=Username(username=@username_of_your_bot), firstName=Name of bot, lastName=, canJoinGroups=(some boolean), canReadAllGroupMessages=(some boolean), supportsInlineQueries=(some boolean))
```

### Docker

In this template there is template-like [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) and [docker](Dockerfile) files. Besides,
there is [Makefile](Makefile) and you may use something like `make buildAndStartCompose` to start your bot.

It is important to replace `"TOKEN"` in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) or remove and add some config as a volume.

* [Github readme](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/TelegramBotAPI)

In other words, this template (and [TelegramBotAPI library](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/TelegramBotAPI)) does
not limit you on choosing of way to continue ðŸ˜Š
